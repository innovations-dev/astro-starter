Key Principles:

- Use PNPM as the package manager.
  - pnpm is aliased as pn
  - pnpm dlx is aliased as px
- Use Astro's built-in components and integrations to build a performant and accessible web application.
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Astro examples.
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively.
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
- Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.
- Implement proper error handling and logging.
- Leverage Astro's RSS feed generation for content-heavy sites.
- Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery.
- Always ensure that all third party libraries and dependencies as well as astro integrations are installed and configured properly.

- Fully leverage Tailwind for styling and animations to create a responsive and engaging user experience.
-
- Use shadcn/ui styles as inspiration for components and design systems.
- Use class-variance-authority for creating variants and themes for components that are compatible with astro's class:list feature.
- Use tailwind whenever possible to add logic to the styles reducing the need for Javascript.
- Use Typescript for type safety and autocomplete to improve development speed and reduce errors.
- Use Zod for validation of the data and to prevent errors (available in Astro's astro:content package).
- Use Javascript optimally for interactivity and functionality to enhance user experience.
- Use the latest web standards and best practices for accessibility, security, and performance optimization.
- Create security conscious api's and form validation.
- Use the Astro framework to create a performant and accessible web application.
- Do not use the tailwind @apply directive in '.astro' files.
- The only framework other than Astro allowed are htmx and alpinejs.

Astro Project Structure

- Use the recommended Astro project structure:

  - src/
    - components/
    - layouts/
    - pages/
    - styles/
      - global.css
    - content/
    - data/
    - schemas/
    - utils/
      - fns/
      - types/
    - config/
  - public/
  - astro.config.mjs
  - .gitignore
  - .eslint.config.cjs
  - .prettierrc
  - .prettierignore
  - tailwind.config.mjs
  - .tsconfig.json
  - .vscode/
    - settings.json
    - extensions.json

  Component Development

  - Create .astro files for Astro components.
  - Use framework-specific components (React, Vue, Svelte) when necessary.
  - Implement proper component composition and reusability.
  - Use Astro's component props for data passing.
  - Leverage Astro's built-in components like <Markdown /> when appropriate.
  - Leverage astro integrations such as astro-seo, astro-robots-txt, astro-icon, @astrojs/sitemap, @astrojs/tailwind,

  Routing and Pages

  - Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the src/pages/ directory.
  - Implement dynamic routes using [...slug].astro syntax.
  - Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.
  - Implement proper 404 handling with a 404.astro page.

  Content Management

  - Use Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) files for content-heavy pages.
  - Leverage Astro's built-in support for frontmatter in Markdown files.
  - Implement content collections for organized content management.

  Styling

  - Use Astro's scoped styling with <style> tags in .astro files.
  - Leverage global styles when necessary, importing them in layouts.
  - Use shadcn/ui styles as inspiration for components and design systems.
    - Specifically use the color theme css variables for handling light and dark themes.
    - Use a performant dark mode toggle for the theme switching.
  - Use tailwind whenever possible to add logic to the styles reducing the need for Javascript.
  - Implement responsive design using CSS custom properties and media queries.

  Performance Optimization

  - Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation and/or tailwind for logical styles.
  - Use the client:\* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
    - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
    - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
    - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
  - Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
  - Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.
  - Use output: "hybrid" in the astro.config.mjs file to leverage the benefits of both static and server-side rendering.

  Data Fetching

  - Use Astro.props for passing data to components typed using interfaces and leverage astro's HTMLAttributes generic for native browser compatibility.
  - Implement getStaticPaths() for fetching data at build time.
  - Use Astro.glob() for working with local files efficiently.
  - Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.

  SEO and Meta Tags

  - Use Astro's <head> tag for adding meta information.
  - Create a DRY json config file for the site's SEO, Structured schema, and opengraph meta tags.
  - Use astro-seo's <Seo/> component for adding SEO and opengraph meta tags.
  - Use a default organization structured data (<script type="application/ld+json">...</script>) for the site.
  - Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
  - Use the <SEO> component pattern for reusable SEO setups.

  Integrations and Plugins

  - Utilize Astro integrations for extending functionality (e.g., @astrojs/image).
  - Implement proper configuration for integrations in astro.config.mjs.
  - Use Astro's official integrations when available for better compatibility.

  Build and Deployment

  - Optimize the build process using Astro's build command.
  - Implement proper environment variable handling for different environments.
  - Implement proper CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.

  - Integrate Tailwind CSS with Astro @astrojs/tailwind

  Tailwind CSS Best Practices

  - Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Astro components.
  - Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
    - refer to the global.css file for custom breakpoints, colors, animations, etc.
  - Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
  - Implement custom theme extensions in tailwind.config.cjs when necessary.
  - Utilize tailwindcss-animate for adding subtle animations to elements to enhance user experience.
  - Never use the @apply directive outside of a global.css file.

  Testing

  - Implement unit tests for utility functions and helpers.
  - Implement visual regression testing if applicable.

  Accessibility

  - Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Astro components.
  - Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.

  3. Implement proper error handling and logging.
  4. Leverage Astro's RSS feed generation for content-heavy sites.
  5. Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery.
  6. Leverage prettier, eslint, and astro's vscode extension for code formatting, linting, and validation.

  Performance Metrics

  - Prioritize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in development.
  - Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance auditing.
  - Implement performance budgets and monitoring.
